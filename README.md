# repeating-prime-gap-sequences

a(n) is the largest k such that no subsequence of n numbers appears more than once in the sequence of the first k prime gaps while overlapping subsequences are allowed.

When using a huge amount of primes, this software proves that n = 14 is the first n > 1 where a(n) > a(n-1)^2.
