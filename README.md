# A344865 integer sequence

a(n) is the largest k such that no subsequence of n numbers appears more than once in the sequence of the first k prime gaps while overlapping subsequences are allowed.

Assumption: The number series is infinitely long.  
If not, the number sequence would end with a(n) and this would mean that there is a function f which can calculate any prime number from nothing but the previous n primes. This is because there would be only a limited amount of possibilities of arranging the input parameters while there is an unlimited amount of primes.
